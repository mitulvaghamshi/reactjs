# Web Usability

- Usability tends to be particularly critical for web applications
- e.g. clean-designed **Facebook** beat out adhoc design **MySpace** and
  dysfunctional **Friendster**
- Most usability concepts translate beyond only web development

## User Interface Design

- A user interface is the area where interaction between a user and the machine
  occurs
- User interface design is about designing user interfaces, goal is to maximize
  usability and user experience
- We'll get into what it means to maximize usability next, for now let's think
  about the word **user**

## Users

- When you design an application, who are you designing it for?
- Should we design interfaces as if all users are the same?
- How are users different from one another?
- Do users all want the same things?

## GUI vs Command-Line

- The graphical user interface is much more intuitive for non-technical users
- Folders and files are represented as graphical files and folders!
- We can drag files into folders, which is conceptually similar to moving a
  physical file into a folder.
- But command-line is for "power users"
- Faster
- More features
- Can write scripts that use commands

## Users may be different...

- Subject expertise
- Technical ability
- Educational background
- Age
- Gender

## User goals and tasks

- User goals are what the user wants to achieve when using an application
  - e.g. find a place to eat
- Tasks are what an application allows a user to accomplish
  - e.g. search for restaurants in a city
- Fulfilling a goal might require multiple tasks

## User Interface Design

- Before we design an application, we should ideally know
- Who are users are
- What their goals are
- What tasks would allow them to achieve these goals
- This information will influence both what we design in terms of tasks allowed,
  but also how we design it in terms of the interface to allow those tasks

## User Research

- User research is how we can understand what goals users have, and what tasks
  will let an application fulfill those goals
- User research is conducted in several ways, including:
  - Interview potential users
  - Focus groups
  - Surveys

## Usability

- **Usability** is the _ease of use of an interface_
- **Usability** in software design is about how well software allows a user to
  fulfill their goals with respect to efficiency, effectiveness and satisfaction
- In other words, usability in software is about more than _how easy is it to
  use_ something

## Usability goals

- Learnability
- Performance (speed, error rates)
- Subjective Satisfaction
- Trust-ability
- There are many others, but these are common

## Learnability

- Learnability describes how easy it is for users to learn how to use an
  application to perform tasks
- Especially the first time(s) they use an application
- Improving learnability
- Less options for users means less confusion
- Predictable layouts, based on similar applications
- Provide tutorials, documentation or guided help

## Performance – speed, error rates

- Performance has multiple categories
- Sometimes called effectiveness or efficiency
- Speed – how fast the app allows users to perform tasks
- e.g. searches performed per minute, how many clicks to do X
- Error rates – how many errors when performing tasks
- e.g. in a game with an accelerometer interface, how often does the game not
  recognize an action? Like swinging a bat?
- We could make laptops slimmer without physical keyboards, but why do designers
  keep them?
- Faster speed, fewer errors than touch screens!

## Subjective satisfaction

- Subjective satisfaction is how satisfied users are when using an interface,
  i.e. how much they like it
  - It's a subjective, emotional state, unlike other things we can measure more
    directly like "words per minute"
- Improving satisfaction probably the most difficult to do with certainty, as
  aspects like aesthetics matter!
- To measure...
  - Ask users how much they enjoyed it from 1-10
  - Ask users which interface they preferred the most

## Trust-ability

- How much do users trust the application they're using?
- This matters a lot for e-commerce websites!
- Users will spend more money on websites that they trust
- Can improve trust by doing things like including reputable logos, transferring
  trust to our application

## Design trade-offs

- One design goal will often come at the expense of another design goal
- Increasing speed of tasks could increase error rates
- Improving learnability could decrease performance
- This is where user interface design gets tricky

## Google search, maps

- Google could theoretically have one search page
  - Instead they have a basic search page and an advanced search page
- Why?
  - A basic search input is enough for 99% of users
  - An advanced search page would be slower for users because there are more
    options to view
  - Solution: basic interface as a default, but allow the advanced interface as
    an option

## What about user experience?

- User experience is an even broader term and idea than usability or user
  interfaces
- User experience includes the user's emotions and attitudes while interacting
  with an interface
- User experience tends to be particularly important for commercial applications

## User interface design

- User interface design guidelines, principles and theories provide guidance and
  rules to help us design interfaces
- Guidelines tend to be lower level and the most specific (e.g. designing for
  iOS apps)
- Principles are more general (e.g. cross-platform advice)
- Theories are even more general and very high-level
- Studies, experiments, and evidence determine the creation of good guidelines,
  principles and theories

## Web accessibility guidelines

- Accessibility guidelines are an extremely important type of design guideline
  - Accessibility guidelines help us to design websites are more inclusive and
    accessible to more people
- e.g. all images must have descriptor text
- [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref)
- Web design guidelines
  - We can find "rules of thumb" in blog articles written by those working in
    industry
  - We can also find large directories of highly researched guidelines

## AODA and ADA compliance

- Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
- Accessibility for Ontarians with Disability Act (AODA)
- Legal requirements for web usability are being phased-in
- In Ontario increasingly smaller businesses and organizations must provide AODA
  compliant websites

## Usability testing

- Usability testing is the process of evaluating user interface designs
- Usability testing can take place at different stages in software development,
- e.g. early usability testing may be done with mockups
- Usability testing may be done with an initial group of beta testers before a
  wider release
- Usability testing may done even after the software has been released to users
- Many different ways, techniques and tools to conduct usability tests:
  - Surveys
  - Interviews
  - Observations
- Usability tests typically have test participants that use the interface and
  provide feedback in some form
- Can be done in any room, or a formal usability lab that may have
  infrastructure like two way mirrors
  - Remote usability testing when the test participant is in another room

## Observations

- Quantitative observations involve measurements
  - e.g. how long in seconds does it take a user to complete Task A, Task B,
    Task C
- Qualitative observations do not involve measurements, but senses (see, hear,
  touch, etc.)
  - e.g. does the participant look frustrated when performing a given task?
  - e.g. does the participant say anything, or appear happy, when they complete
    a task?

## Interviews

- Can ask participants a standard set of questions before, during, and/or after
  they use an interface
- Interviews much higher fidelity than surveys in terms of the information
  garnered, but much more resource intensive in terms of time required
- Also allow for follow-up questions, instead of just saying something is
  "annoying", can ask "why?"

## Surveys

- Surveys allow us to gather precise data on specific questions, potentially
  with a score ("rate from 1-5")
- Surveys are quicker, easier, and less resource intensive than interviews
- Surveys can also be made anonymous, which has advantages in terms of
  participant honesty
- If the one conducting the test is the one who built the product... do
  participants want to tell them that "their baby is ugly?"
