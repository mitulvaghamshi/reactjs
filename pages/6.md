# Conditional Rendering

## ReactJS app style

- Quick note: There's nothing wrong with rendering ReactJS components to
  multiple HTML divs
- You see this sometimes when ReactJS is being integrated into already existing
  apps
- But what's normally expected in ReactJS is to render the entire app to one
  root div, and to have everything on the page defined as components (i.e. other
  than `body/head` tags, no other "regular HTML")
- Only use `ReactDOM.render` once to render your entire app into a single div

## Conditional rendering

- We may want to conditionally render components or not based on some value or
  component state e.g. display a warning message or not?
- But how can we do this if we can't have if-statements in JSX code?
- One option: use an if-statement (or switch, etc), outside the JSX (but within
  the render method) to save desired JSX segment to a variable
- Then reference the variable within JSX with `{varname}`

```jsx
render () {
   let toRender;

   if (this.state.mystate) {
      toRender = <AComponent />
   } else {
      toRender = <BComponent />
   }

   return (
      <h1>Conditionally render a component</h1>
      <button onClick={this.switchFunc}>Switch</button>
      {toRender}
   );
```

## map

- We can create lists (or rows/cells) by using `map`
- When we create lists, we need to provide a unique key attribute for each list
  element
- ReactJS uses this information to know "what is what" when it re-orders or
  add/removes from the list

```jsx
renderComment({body, author}) {
   return <li key={author}>{body}—{author}</li>;
}

render() {
   return <ul>{this.state.comments.map(this.renderComment)}</ul>;
}
```

## A design pattern

- If you've discovered a great solution to a problem that occurs often, why not
  re-use the solution?
  - Design patterns are general, repeatable solutions to frequently occurring
    problems in software design
  - Design patterns break solutions into separate pieces that each play a
    different role
  - Mitigates "spaghetti code" or what some call a "big ball of mud" by
    assigning roles, and communication between pieces
  - Allows developers to work in parallel on each piece
- Model—view-controller is a popular design pattern you may have come across
  - Very widely adopted in web development in particular
  - It helps to separate business logic from user interface
- React apps are made up of components interacting with components, possibly in
  the hundreds
- Is there any way we can use a design pattern to make reasoning about all this
  easier?

## Container and Presentation components

- New design pattern: **Container and Presentation components**
- Many different names for the same idea:
  - Fat vs. skinny components
  - Smart vs. dumb components
  - Stateful vs. pure components
- Presentation components specify presentation logic, i.e. how things look
- Receive data and callback functions exclusively through props
- Would contain tags like `<li>`, `<p>`, `<table>`, etc.
- Container components specify business logic, i.e. how things work
- Fetch the data, and provide the data and behaviour to presentational or other
  container components
- Typically only contain `<div>` tags and other component tags
- Presentation components should not...
  - have state
  - contain function definitions for reacting to events
  - do data transfer with ajax calls or other methods

## Why use this design pattern?

- Separation of concerns
  - Our code is easier to understand because we know what parts are responsible
    for doing what
- Re-usability
  - We can re-use presentational components with different container components
    (and vice versa)
- It may be hard to appreciate the importance of these advantages in small apps
  but as apps scale in number of lines of code patterns become essential

## Event handlers with arguments

- If the container component is passing down event handler functions, how can
  the presentation component pass arguments to the event handler?
- Which list item was clicked?
- Which cell in a table was clicked?
- The `.bind` method can be used to pass an argument in this situation, by
  providing it as the second argument
- See
  [Handling Events - reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html)

## Forms and inputs

- We can create a click handler to deal with a button being clicked or or form
  being submitted
- But how do we get the value of an input text box from within this handler?
- In jQuery/JavaScript, we might use a selector or `document.getElementById`
- But that involves DOM access/manipulation, which we want to avoid in ReactJS
- Now how do we do this in ReactJS?
- ReactJS should ideally keep track of all "app state"
- We might not think of it as state, but the value contained in an input text
  box is a type of state
- We would rather not have "two sources of the truth"
- The value in the input text box rendered HTML would be another "source of the
  true state of our program"
- Solution: create an `onChange` event handler for our input text box, which
  updates the state of a (container) component every time the contents are
  modified
- Container component also passes this as a prop to the presentation component
  that renders the input text box
- Having an `onChange` event update component state means that other event
  handlers (like submit buttons, etc) can now have access to this state
- A [form input element](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html) whose values is
  controlled in ReactJS like this is called a "controlled component"
