# Lifecycle Methods

- Components have **lifecycle methods** that can be overridden to run code at
  particular times in the component's lifecycle
- A component's lifecycle is the time in which it exists
- Methods containing the word **will** are called right _before_ something
  happens
- Methods containing the word **did** are called right _after_ something happens

## mounting

- Methods that are called when an instance of a component is being created and
  inserted into the DOM:
  - `constructor()`
  - `static getDerivedStateFromProps()`
  - `render()`
  - `componentDidMount()`

## updating

- Methods that are called when a component is being re-rendered, because state
  or props have changed:
  - `static getDerivedStateFromProps()`
  - `shouldComponentUpdate()`
  - `render()`
  - `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()`
  - `componentDidUpdate()`

## unmounting

- Method called when a component is being removed from the DOM:
  - componentWillUnmount()

## Lifecycle methods

- We can use `componentDidCatch()` when an error has occurred during the
  component lifecycle as well as static `getDerivedStateFromError()`
- Component lifecycle method documentation:
  - [the-component-lifecycle - reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#the-component-lifecycle)
  - [state-and-lifecycle - reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)

## AJAX with React

- `componentDidMount()` is industry
  [standard place to put an initial AJAX call](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-ajax.html#where-in-the-component-lifecycle-should-i-make-an-ajax-call)
  which obtains data for a component
- Subsequent AJAX calls can take place in response to events, in the event
  handling functions

## Why no AJAX in the constructor?

- AJAX requests are asynchronous and take time to complete
- By the time an AJAX call in a constructor completes, the component will have
  already been created and mounted
- Which means we can no longer use `this.state` to update the component state,
  it won't be reflected in rendered result because `render()` is never called

## AJAX with React

- We can technically use jQuery AJAX methods to do AJAX calls with React
- But jQuery is very heavyweight for this use case, includes a lot of DOM
  manipulation functionality that we don't need at all with ReactJS
- Unless it's a situation where we're already loading jQuery, say because we are
  adding React to an existing app, it's better to use a different library

## Fetch API

- A new native
  [JavaScript API for AJAX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)
  calls
- Much more lightweight, you don't even need to load a new library
- Not supported by some _older browsers_, but not a big problem
- [Other libraries](https://hashnode.com/post/5-best-libraries-for-making-ajax-calls-in-react-cis8x5f7k0jl7th53z68s41k1)
  exist that are lighter weight than jQuery but more universal than Fetch
