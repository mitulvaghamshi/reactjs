# ECMA Script 6

## JavaScript changes

- ES6 introduced new features and syntactic sugars to JavaScript, browsers now
  largely support ES6
  - ES stands for ECMAScript, standardization of JavaScript
- We'll see new concepts when using React and reading React examples online
  - Objects, Promises, Arrow functions, etc.
  - We'll cover concepts we know you'll see in examples for sure
  - We can't cover every possible language feature however!
- ES6 changes are _extensive_ and include some rarely used concepts/syntax, as
  you get closer to bleeding edge tech, it's just something you have to expect

## JavaScript objects

- We've been using below syntax for JS objects already
- Key/value pairs to define properties and values
- Methods as properties with functions as values
- `this` keyword to access properties of this object

```js
var person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  id: 5566,
  fullName: function () {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  },
};
```

- We can create constructors for objects...

```js
function Person(first, last, age, eye) {
  this.firstName = first;
  this.lastName = last;
  this.age = age;
  this.eyeColor = eye;
}

var myFather = new Person("John", "Doe", 50, "blue");
```

## Classes

- We can use class and constructor as we may be familiar with from Java and
  other languages
- These don't really introduce anything fundamentally new however
- It's called a syntactic sugar because it's just another way of doing what we
  can already do

## JavaScript object with class

```js
class Rectangle {
  constructor(height, width) {
    this.height = height;
    this.width = width;
  }

  calcArea() {
    return this.height * this.width;
  }
}
```

## Child classes

```js
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(this.name + " makes a noise.");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    // call the super class constructor and pass in the name parameter
    super(name);
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(this.name + " barks.");
  }
}
```

## Arrow functions

- Arrow functions, like anonymous functions except...
  - Shorter syntax than regular functions
  - Does not have its own this
  - Generally not named when used, and generally used exactly where they are
    defined, often as part of a map
- Syntax:

```js
(param1, param2, ..., paramN) => { statements }
// below line is equivalent to: => { return expression; }
(param1, param2, ..., paramN) => expression
```

- Example:

```js
// 1
var materials = [
  "Hydrogen",
  "Helium",
  "Lithium",
  "Beryllium",
];

console.log(materials.map((material) => material.length));

// expected output: Array [8, 6, 7, 9]

// 2
[1, 2, 3].map((x) => 2 * x); // returns [ 2, 4, 6 ]
var funcName = (x, y) => x + y + 2;
funcName(2, 4); // returns 8
```

## let keyword

- `let` allows us to make declarations with block-level scope, previously JS
  only allowed for function and global level scope

```js
var x = 10; // Here x is 10
{
  let x = 2; // Here x is 2
}
// Here x is 10
```

- If we didn't use `let`, `x` would be re-declared and set to 2 outside the
  block scope as well!

## const keyword

- `const` allows us to create variables that cannot be re-assigned
  - Other than this, they behave like variables declared with the let keyword
- `const` strictly speaking does not define constant values as may be expected
  - Technically `const` defines a constant reference to a value
  - So for primitive values, it behaves like a constant value
  - But for `const` objects, because it's just the reference that is constant,
    we can still change the object's properties

```js
const PI = 3.14159265359;

// You can create a const object:
const car = { type: "Fiat", model: "500", color: "white" };

// You can change a property:
car.color = "red";

// ERROR THIS WON'T WORK!
car = { type: "Volvo", model: "EX60", color: "red" };
```

## bind

- The `bind()` method creates a new function from an existing function that has
  its this keyword set to the value provided
- Syntax:

```js
functionName.bind(this);
```

- Example:

```js
var module = {
  x: 42,
  getX: function () {
    return this.x;
  },
};

var unboundGetX = module.getX;

// outputs undefined
console.log(unboundGetX());

// The function gets invoked at the global scope
var boundGetX = unboundGetX.bind(module);

// outputs 42
console.log(boundGetX());

// outputs 42
console.log(module.getX());
```

## Promises

- Event handlers are great for situations where we want something to occur every
  time in response to an event
- What about something that only occurs once?

```js
var img1 = document.querySelector(".img-1");
img1.addEventListener("load", function () {
  // woo yey image loaded
});
```

- What if the image has already loaded before we setup the event handler?
- Promises behave like event listeners, except a promise can succeed or fail
  only once (and it cannot switch from success to failure)

```js
var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    // do a thing, possibly async, then...
    if (/* everything turned out fine */) {
        resolve("Stuff worked!");
    } else {
        reject(Error("It broke"));
    }
});

promise.then(function(result) {
    console.log(result); // "Stuff worked!"
}, function(err) {
    console.log(err); // Error: "It broke"
});
```

## Promises with jQuery AJAX

```js
// returns a promise!
var req = $.ajax({ url: "/data/people.json", dataType: "json" });
var success = function (resp) {
  $("#target").append("<p>people: " + resp.people.length + "</p>");
  console.log(resp.people);
};
var err = function (req, status, err) {
  $("#target").append("<p>something went wrong</p>");
};
req.then(success, err);
```
