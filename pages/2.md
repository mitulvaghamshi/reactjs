## Content management systems

- Content management systems are applications used to manage digital content
  (i.e. web pages)
  - Multiple users can access a "backend" that allows them to create articles
    and other content viewable by the public on the "frontend"
  - Potentially multiple different types of users... publishers, editors,
    administrators, etc.
- Content Management Systems in one form or another power roughly 50% of the web
  - Drupal, WordPress & Joomla are 3 biggest - all use PHP!

## WordPress

- WordPress is the most popular CMS
- Powers roughly 1/3rd of the web, tens of millions of sites
- Based on PHP & MySQL, first released in 2003
- Most associated with blogging, but can support all kinds of web content (e.g.
  forums, web stores, etc)
- Supported by massive community online and offline
- WordPress features a plugin architecture and template engine
  - Both involve "one click installs" that allow us to greatly customize website
    functionality
- Templates are called "themes" in WordPress
  - Allow sites to change appearance entirely
  - Can be customized by users, created and sold for profit
- Plugins extend the functionality of WordPress
  - e.g. plugins for calendars, forums, e-commerce, etc
  - Can also be customized, created and sold for profit

## XAMPP

- XAMPP allows us to run an Apache web server with PHP and MySQL locally
  - A similar environment to CSUnix, but on our machine
  - We'll use XAMPP for WordPress because CSUnix has configuration issues and
    slow performance
  - You can [Install XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) free
- After installing XAMPP, PHP and other files placed under the htdocs folder
  will be accessible in the browser at the URL localhost

## MAMP

- MAMP is an equivalent to XAMPP for Mac
  - You can also get XAMPP for Mac, but the configuration doesn't work well with
    WordPress
  - If you're on a Mac, use MAMP for WordPress
  - You can [Install MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en)
- MAMP also has an htdocs folder that is mapped to the server running at
  localhost
  - Change the Apache port to 80

## WordPress installation

- [Download](https://en-ca.wordpress.org/download/#download-install) it from
  WordPress.org
- Follow the
  [guide to install](https://wordpress.org/support/article/how-to-install-wordpress)
  WordPress
- Create a database with `phpMyAdmin` called `wordpress` for your wordpress
  database!
- With XAMPP the MySQL database username is `root` and the password is `""`
- With MAMP the MySQL database username is `root` and the password is `root`

## WordPress Themes

- WordPress themes define much of the style, layout and structure for a
  WordPress website
- E.g. themes define where a menu appears on the page, but not which items are
  in the menu
- WordPress
  [theme repository](https://en-ca.wordpress.org/themes/browse/featured)
- There are other repositories and paid websites hosting premium themes
- Installing WordPress Themes can usually be done automatically from the backend
- WordPress themes can also be installed by unzipping them into
  /wp-content/themes folder
- WordPress themes then need to be activated to make them the currently used
  theme

## WordPress Theme Development

- [Official documentation](https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development)
- Anyone can build and release entirely new WordPress themes built from scratch
  - Whether this is "worth it" or not is a business question
- But what's a lot more common is to build child themes themes that inherit all
  of the styling of a parent theme, and then make modifications
  - Allows us to customize pre-existing themes however we like

## WordPress theme files

- WordPress themes may contain a lot of different files that work together,
  let's go through them
- styles.css
  - Defines the CSS styles for the theme
  - May contain all the styles, it's possible to split styles over multiple
    files
  - Also contains theme details in comments at the top of the page
  - These theme details must be present for the theme to work
  - No two themes may have the same details
- screenshot.webp
  - This will represent the theme in the WordPress backend theme selection page
- js, img, fonts, etc folders
  - These folders contain images, Javascript, fonts and other code used by the
    theme to render the page
- functions.php
  - Basically acts like a plugin... it's run by WordPress during initialization
  - Can define helper functions used in your theme files
  - Loads theme style sheets and scripts
  - Enables theme features such as sidebars, navigation menus, etc.
  - Set up an option menu to allow admin users the ability to change aspects of
    the theme
- Template files
  - [Template files](https://codex.wordpress.org/Stepping_Into_Templates) define
    different portions of the page
  - At a minimum, an index.php file must be present
  - Template files like single.php define the page for a single post, page.php
    for a page, etc.
  - Other template files like header.php, footer.php, sidebar.php typically
    exist for defining those portions of the page
  - index.php will include these different parts of the page with code like
    `<?php get_header() ?>` and/or load in different templates with
    `get_template_part()`

## WordPress theme modifications

- Often it's cost and time prohibitive to create themes from scratch, and we can
  find a theme that is "very close" to what we need anyways
- We can technically modify the theme files directly to alter the behaviour and
  style of the theme
  - Problem: themes themselves regularly update, and when the theme updates,
    your modifications will be overwritten!
- Solution: child themes
  - Allow us to make tweaks to existing themes that won't be overwritten when
    the parent theme is updated

## WordPress child themes

- Child themes can be created by creating a directory called `parentname-child`
  under the `/wp-content/themes` folder
  - Where `parentname` is the name of the parent theme
- You can then define a style.css file that provides additional styles and/or
  re-defines existing files
  - Your style.css file will need to have a unique Theme Name, and it will need
    to reference the parent theme with Template (i.e. Template: `twentyfifteen`)
- You also must provide a functions.php file that loads in the parent themes
  style sheets
- See
  [full details](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes)
  on creating child themes
