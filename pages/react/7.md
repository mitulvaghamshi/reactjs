# Hooks

## Quick overview: function components

- Defined using a function that returns JSX, possibly uses props:

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

- But until recently these components had no access to state, lifecycle methods,
  etc
- All they could do is receive props and render

## Const and arrow functions

- It's very common to see `const Name = (props) => { };` used to define
  components
- as opposed to `function Name(props) { }`
- Also common to see arrow functions used to define event handlers and other
  functions in components

```jsx
const Example = (props) => {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(props.value);
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCounter(counter + 1)}>
      You clicked me {counter} times.
    </button>
  );
};
```

## Setting default props

- We can set default props with function components the exact same as class
  components

```jsx
Example.defaultProps = { value: 4 };
```

- This is because functions in JavaScript are also objects

## Hooks

- Hooks allow us to use state and other features of React class components in
  function components
- Hooks introduced in version 16.8 of React
- Hooks are 100% backwards compatible with "old React"
- i.e. we can mix code using hooks with traditional React components
- React team says hooks will not replace class components
- Understanding hooks still requires us to understand props, state, etc

## Why use hooks?

- Hooks allow us to more easily re-use code that manipulates state across
  different components
- Hooks allow us to more easily breakup code that manipulates state within a
  single component
- JavaScript classes are confusing for developers
- In particular, the React team acknowledges that how the keyword this works in
  JavaScript is a struggle for people

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <p>You clicked {count} times.</p>
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click Me!</button>
  );
}
```

## Import

- Remember to import `useState` or we will not have access to the useState hook

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
```

## Assigning to an array

```jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

- `useState` is returning TWO things and we're assigning them to `count` and
  `setCount`
- One is a variable, the other is a function
- This is called
  [array destructing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#array_destructuring)

## useState() hook

- Concepts like:
  - Conditional rendering
  - Two-way data binding and controlled components
  - Event handlers
  - Including with arguments
  - List rendering
- Basically carry over to Hooks exactly as expected
- Except we use the individual set functions instead of `setState`

```jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

- Creates a state variable `count`
- State variable `count` is initialized `0`
- Returns a function `setCount` that allows us to update `count`
- A bit like a `setState()` function but only for `count`

## State variable output

- We can then use the state variable `count` in our JSX expression as we could
  the keys of `this.state`

```jsx
<p>You clicked {count} times</p>;
```

## State variable modification

- We can modify the state variable using `setCount()`
- Like `setState()` calling `setCount()` will cause the component to re-render

```jsx
<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
```

## Two-way data binding

- For example two-way data binding has the same 3 key parts of:
  - a state variable,
  - output the variable into the input value,
  - setting the variable `onChange`

```jsx
const [inputGrade, setInputGrade] = useState("");

function handleGradeChange(event) {
  setInputGrade(event.target.value);
}

<input type="text" value={inputGrade} onChange={handleGradeChange} />;
```

## What about event handlers?

- We can get rid of bind and using the this keyword entirely if we use an arrow
  function that calls our event handler with an argument

```jsx
<span onClick={() => deleteGrade(x_grade.id)}>Delete</span>;
```

## useEffect()

- Effects are essentially a replacement for lifecycle methods in function
  components
- We can provide a function to `useEffect()` called an effect that is by default
  called
  - When a component first mounts to the DOM
  - Whenever a component is rendered again
- We can use `useEffect()` multiple times
- Allows us to split up functions by different functionalities
- As opposed to having to stick all code under `componentDidMount()` because it
  needs to run on mounting

```jsx
// The function supplied here will run on mount and every render
function Component(props) {
  useEffect(function () {
    console.log("Inside useEffect...");
  });

  return <h1>Test</h1>;
}
```

- `useEffect` can be used for things like:
  - Connecting to APIs
  - Communication
  - Fetching data from databases
  - Making initial AJAX request to get data
- Again, very similar to lifecycle methods
- Often these operations require a "cleanup step"
- e.g. disconnecting from a database or API

## useEffect() cleanup function

- Effects can optionally return a cleanup function that is by default called
- Before every subsequent call of the effect function after the first call of
  the effect function
- When a component unmounts

```jsx
useEffect(function () {
  console.log("Inside useEffect...");
  return function () {
    console.log("Cleanup...");
  };
});
```

## useEffect() default behaviour

- What if we don't want an effect function to run before every single render as
  it does by default?
- Same issue with the `cleanup()` function if it is provided
- For example, how would we use an effect to make an initial AJAX request for
  data?
- The default behaviour of an effect would result in the AJAX request happening
  after every single render
- React has designed a solution for this use case...

## useEffect() 2nd argument

- We can optionally provide an `array` as a 2nd argument to `useEffect`
- The array can contain values like **props** or **state** variables
- If any of the values change, the `effect/cleanup` will execute again on
  renders

```jsx
setEffect(() => {
  console.log("do some work...");
  return () => {
    console.log("do some cleanup work");
  };
}, [props.data]); // Only runs effect again if `props.data` changes
```

- Effectively allows us to set "conditions" for when running an effect is
  actually necessary, highly flexible in this regard

## Important: empty array case

```jsx
setEffect(() => {
  console.log("do some work");
  return () => {
    console.log("do some cleanup work");
  };
}, []); // Only runs effect again if `props.data` changes
```

- If we supply an empty array `[]` the effect and cleanup will only run on
  component `mount/unmount`
- We can use this to implement an initial
  [AJAX request](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-ajax.html) to fetch data once
