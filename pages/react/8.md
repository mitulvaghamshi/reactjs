# React Router

## SPAs with ReactJS

- Single-page applications load a single HTML page, and then dynamically update
  the page as the user interactions with the application
- New problem with SPAs is that the user expects certain functionality from the
  browser, and how do we maintain it?

## SPAs

- SPAs will need to support the following:
  - URL in the browser bar must match what the user is viewing
  - Browser back and forward buttons should function as expected
  - User should be able to build a URL to navigate towards a particular view
  - i.e. that the user is viewing x subpage

## React Router

- React Router library was created to help developers make single-page
  applications with ReactJS
- React Router works to keep the URL in sync with the UI
- React Router works in conjunction with React, using ideas such as components
  that developers are already familiar with using

## Installation

- Use create-react-app to create your app

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start # (to test it)
```

- Next, in the my-app folder type in:

```sh
npm install react-router-dom
```

- npm will download the react router files
- Then at the top off `App.js` or other `.js` files using React Router
  components, add a statement like:

```jsx
import {
  BrowserRouter as Router,
  Link,
  NavLink,
  Route,
} from "react-router-dom";
```

## Links

- React Router works by using Link components which create links to paths that
  React Router will recognize
- This component would create a link to `/linkpage/list` that React Router can
  recognize
- e.g. `myapproot.com/linkpage/list`

```jsx
<Link to="/linkpage/list">List</Link>;
```

## Routes

- Route components will render a component when the path matches the path
  provided as the path prop
- The component rendered is also provided as a prop
- The component will be rendered directly where the Route component is defined
- This component would render the component `ListComp` when the path of the app
  is `/linkpage/list`

```jsx
<Route path="/linkpage/list" component={ListComp} />;
```

- So if the URL was `myapproot.com/linkpage/list`, then the component `Listcomp`
  would render where this Route is

## Router component

- React Router requires routes and links to be enclosed in a Router component
- Router components can only have one child component, so you can put all of the
  contents inside a div
- There are different types of Router components, in our case we imported
  "BrowserRouter" as "Router"
- `BrowserRouter` uses HTML5 history API to keep track of URL
- `HashRouter` uses a hash portion of the URL to keep track

```jsx
<Router>
  <div>
    <Link to="/linkpage/table">About</Link>
    <Link to="/linkpage/list">List</Link>
    <Route path="/linkpage/table" component={TableComp} />
    <Route path="/linkpage/list" component={ListComp} />
  </div>
</Router>;
```

## NavLink

- `NavLink` does the same thing as the `Link` component, except if the link is
  "active" (i.e. it matches the current path) it styles the link
- It will style the link with the "active" css class, however you define it
- Idea is to use this when creating navigational links where it's common to
  style the current page a user is on

```jsx
<NavLink to="/contact">Contact</NavLink>;
```

## Root paths

- In the case of our root path nav link:

```jsx
<NavLink to="/">Home</NavLink>;
```

- `NavLink` will always recognize this as the active path, even if the path is
  `myapp.com/about`, root path still matches too
- Solution is to use the exact prop to let React Router to match this path
  exactly

```jsx
<NavLink exact to="/">Home</NavLink>;
```

- We need to do the same thing for our Route matching the root path, otherwise
  it will always render

```jsx
<Route exact path="/" component={Home} />;
```

## URL parameters

- To handle URL parameters in our routes, when defining our route put a colon
  followed by the parameter name

```jsx
<Route path="/urlparm/:someid" component={URLParmExample} />;
```

- The value of the URL parameter `someid` will then be available in the rendered
  component (in this case, `URLParmExample`) using `this.props.match.params`

```jsx
class URLParmExample extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <p>URL parm: {this.props.match.params.someid}</p>;
  }
}
```
