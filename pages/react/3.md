# JSX

- This is a JSX, which is a lot like HTML

```html
<script type="text/babel">
     ReactDOM.render(
          <h1>Hello, world!</h1>,
          document.getElementById('title')
     );
</script>
```

- JSX is a JavaScript syntax extension that looks similar to XML/HTML
- It is not JavaScript, web browsers don't interpret it
- Very similar to HTML, with a few key differences
- Concise and familiar syntax for defining tree structures with attributes
- JSX must be compiled into JavaScript
- Babel will handle this for us

## JSX compilation

- JSX Source Code

```jsx
<div className="red">Children Text</div>;
<MyCounter count={3 + 5} />;
var gameScores = { player1: 2, player2: 5 };
<DashboardUnit data-index="2">
  <h1>Scores</h1>
  <Scoreboard className="results" scores={gameScores} />
</DashboardUnit>;
```

- JSX Code Compiled

```js
React.createElement("div", { className: "red" }, "Children Text");
React.createElement(MyCounter, { count: 3 + 5 });
React.createElement(
  DashboardUnit,
  { "data-index": "2" },
  React.createElement("h1", null, "Scores"),
  React.createElement(Scoreboard, { className: "results", scores: gameScores }),
);
```

- JSX is what we will use to create the re-usable ReactJS components
- It's possible to write components using the long-form `createElement` too, but
  we won't do this
- In a production environment, JSX is preprocessed and stored server side to
  increase performance, instead of using Babel on client side
- Babel just lets us get up and running things quickly!
- JSX elements can be put anywhere that JavaScript expressions can be placed:

```js
var x = <h1>test</h1>;
var y = { a: <td>1</td>, b: <td>2</td> };
```

- JSX elements can have attributes, and be nested within other JSX elements:

```html
<a href="https://www.disney.com" id="my-link"><h1>Disney</h1></a>
```

- JSX expressions must have exactly one outer element (remember what happens to
  JSX code when it's compiled to JavaScript functions), so this would be
  invalid:

```jsx
var x = (
     <a href="https://www.disney.com" id="mylink"><h1>Disney</h1></a>
     <a href="https://www.google.com" id="mylink"><h1>Google</h1></a>
);
```

- As a result, with JSX you will very often see a _wrapping div_

## JSX vs. HTML differences

- Class attribute becomes `className` in JSX

```html
<p className="my-class">test</p>
<!-- instead of -->
<p class="my-class">test</p>
```

- This is because class is a keyword in JavaScript
- Single-tag elements must have a closing / in JSX

```jsx
<br />;
```

- Event handlers must be written in `camelCase` in JSX

```html
<img onClick={whatever} />
<!-- instead of -->
<img onclick={whatever} />
```

## JavaScript inside JSX expressions

```jsx
var name = "John Doe";
var myJsx = <h1>Welcome, {name}!</h1>;

function test() {
  alert("test");
}

var myImg = <img onClick={test} />;
```

- Can use `{ }` to access variables while inside a JSX expression
- Often used to set attribute values

## JSX and if statements

- You cannot put an if-statement inside JSX, for example this would be invalid:

```jsx
var myJsx = (<h1>{if (x) 'mytitle'}</h1>);
```

- We can however use the ternary operator
- If-statements open the possibility to more logic

## Producing lists in JSX

- The array method `.map` is the usual way to build lists in ReactJS from a set
  of data:

```jsx
var myData = ["item-1", "item-2", "item-3"];
var myList = myData.map((value) => <li>{value}</li>);

<ul>{myList}</ul>;
```
