# Components

- Compartmentalizing functionality into explicitly-defined, re-usable and
  extendable subcomponents is critical to large-scale software project viability
  - Functions
  - Classes/objects
  - Modules
- Why doesn't front-end web dev work this way?
- We can use HTML templates, sure, but we can't create new HTML elements
  themselves
- ReactJS components essentially give us this ability
- Components are the building blocks of React applications
- Components are re-usable, and intended to have a single responsibility
- Components often aren't particularly interesting on their own
- Components may use and interact with other components
- ReactJS apps are made up of potentially thousands of interacting components

## Component, Hello World!

```jsx
class MyComponentClass extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<MyComponentClass />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

- We create a class that extends `React.Component`
- The class name needs to be **UpperCamelCase**
- The class must have a `render` function which returns a JSX expression

## Components

- We can now create and render our own components
- We can use the components we create like we do other JSX elements
- So we could use `<MyComponentClass />` in a JSX expression, and that would be
  valid
- You can think of it like extending HTML (in a way)
- Extending `React.Component` creates a child class, a new type of component in
  React
- We need to have a `render` function
- Setting other properties will give components more power

```jsx
class Guess extends React.Component {
  render () {
    var myGuess = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100 + 1);

    return (
      <h1>Guess</h1>
      <p>My guess: {myGuess}</p>
    );
   }
};
```

- Note that we can have multiple lines of JSX returned with brackets `()` around
  the return value;
- We can have calculations and other JS code in render function!

```jsx
class Button extends React.Component {
  myfunc() {
    alert("myfunc");
  }

  render() {
    return <button onClick={this.myfunc.bind(this)}>ClickMe!</button>;
  }
}
```

- We can setup events like `onClick`
- We can use the this keyword to reference properties and methods of the class
- In the case of setting up events, we need to use `.bind(this)` to bind the
  method to the object

## Using components

```jsx
class ChildComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <p>Hello, World!</p>;
  }
}

class ParentComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <ChildComponent />;
  }
}
```

- In this example, `ParentComponent` will have the effect of rendering
  `ChildComponent` by including it

```jsx
class MyPage extends React.Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <Header />
      <Navigation />
      <Body />
      <Footer />
    );
  }
};
```

- You can now start to imagine more complex components, using multiple other
  components

## props

- To be more useful, components will need to interact beyond just rendering
  other components
- Components can pass information down to other components using `props`
- Props are like attributes in HTML, and we can access them in the component
  like an object with a `key/value`

```jsx
class DisplayMyProp extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <p>{this.props.myProp}</p>;
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <DisplayMyProp myProp="Hello World" />,
  document.getElementById("myID"),
);

// `this.props` will contain any attribute-style information

class DisplayMyProp extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <p>{this.props.myProp}</p>;
  }
}

DisplayMyProp.defaultProps = { myProp: "Default Text" };

ReactDOM.render(<DisplayMyProp />, document.getElementById("myID"));
```

- The default props to be used if none are provided, you can use the
  `defaultProps` property of the class, by providing an object containing
  default prop values, in this case `this.props.myProp` would be set to
  `"Default Text"`

## prop event handlers

```jsx
class ParentComponent extends React.Component {
  handleClick() {
    alert("hello, world");
  }

  render() {
    return <ChildComponent onClick={this.handleClick} />;
  }
}

class ChildComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <p onClick={this.props.onClick.bind(this)}>Click</p>;
  }
}
```

- We can pass an event handler as a prop
- E.g. maybe we have a list, with a standard click event for each element
- Convention is to use `handleEventType` as the prop name in the component where
  the event handler was defined (e.g. `handleKeyPress`)

## state

- In addition to props for setting internal state (`this.props`), components
  also have `this.state`
- Props are state that is set **externally**, it's passed in from the outside
- State is state that is set **internally**, it's set _and/or_ decided on from
  the inside of the component

```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { mystate: "Hello World" };
  }
  render() {
    return <p>{this.state.mystate}</p>;
  }
}
```

- `this.state` is used to access the state, similar to props
- The initial state can be setup in the constructor, which when used should
  always accept props as a parameter and call the base class constructor with
  props
- To change component state, you can call `this.setState({ key: value });`
- State provided is **merged** with the old state
- State properties will then be overridden with new values where there are new
  values
- Any other state properties will remain the same where no new values are
  provided
- `this.setState()` _cannot be called_ from within `render`
- This will be explained in a moment

```jsx
class MyState extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { mystate: "a" };
  }

  changeState() {
    var myNewState = this.state.mystate == "a" ? "b" : "a";
    this.setState({ mystate: myNewState });
  }
  render() {
    return <p onClick={this.changeState.bind(this)}>{this.state.mystate}</p>;
  }
}
```

- After a click, would we need to render again to see the change?
- Every time that `this.setState` is called, ReactJS will automatically call
  render immediately afterwards
- This is why we can't call `this.setState` from inside render (_it would create
  an infinite loop_)
- This allows components to impact their own rendering, as opposed to say having
  to traverse a data structure and update only certain elements
- What should be in state?
- State should contain data that a component's event handlers may change to
  trigger a **UI update**
- E.g. highlighted or not highlighted?
- What should not be in state?
- Duplicated data from props
- Pre-computed data (just compute any data in render)
- React components (just put them in render)

## ES5 vs ES6 style components

- Before ES6 style components, there were ES5 style components defined using the
  limitations of ES5
- The **React World** has transitioned to ES6, but for years it was done using
  ES5, so there are still some tutorials online using ES5 style
- It's also still possible to
  [create components without using es6 style](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-es6.html)
- Use ES6 style component:

```jsx
var MyState = React.createClass({
  getInitialState: function () {
    return { mystate: "a" };
  },
  changeState: function () {
    var myNewState = this.state.mystate == "a" ? "b" : "a";
    this.setState({ mystate: myNewState });
  },

  render: function () {
    return <p onClick={this.changeState}>{this.state.mystate}</p>;
  },
});
```

## Function components

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

- This is a function component that defines a component Welcome, in contrast to
  the class components
- The component props are the parameter of the function, and the function's
  return value is the equivalent of a class component's render function
- Some people call function components _pure components_, _functional
  components_ or _pure functional components_
- Originally functional components had no access to state and were used for
  rendering data provided via props, this is where the name **pure** comes from
- Then React added **hooks** which allow function components to access state

## ReactJS Syntax

- There are alternative syntax's you may come across for defining and using
  React Components
- Strictly speaking, you don't need to ever use these, however you may seem them
  in code examples you find online

## Functional components

- A function that accepts a single props object argument and returns a React
  element is a valid component

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

- Sometimes called _stateless functional components_

## Why use functional components?

- Suitable for presentation components
- Also helps to enforce container-presentation pattern, as you can't add state
  to functional components (something that may be tempting if it is possible)
- Less code clutter (no class, extends, etc)
- More important than you think as number of components scales, concise
  definitions of many, simple components vastly improve readability
- Functional components can also be created using arrow functions

```jsx
// Instead of
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

// We could have
var Welcome = ({ props }) => <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
```

## Const

- We'll often see const used when defining components

```jsx
const Welcome = ({ props }) => <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
```

- Remember: components like this are going to be used by React to render our app
- In this context of React, it makes no sense to ever _re-assign Welcome to
  something else later_
- So declaring with `const` prevents someone from making this mistake later

## Styling components

- CSS we define in usual CSS files or in-between style tags will still be
  applied to components as they are rendered
- Can use IDs and classes just as we do with regular HTML
- Remember that React ultimately turns everything into HTML, CSS and JS

## ReactJS

- React applications are made up of many components, setting props and modifying
  state
- We can compose these components together to create larger applications
- How does it make sense to compose components? Design patterns may help us!

## Important: build the "React Way"

- When we make React apps, the expectation is we're using state, props,
  components, etc, to implement functionality
- If we don't use these tools to implement our applications, our applications
  can have serious bugs
- In particular, we should never manipulate the DOM directly in a React app or
  setup JavaScript event handlers outside of React
- It completely defeats the purpose of using React
- React no longer has control over the DOM, which means we can get all sorts of
  bugs
- So don't do these things and don't use jQuery either to modify the DOM or
  setup event handlers
