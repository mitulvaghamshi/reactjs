## Toolchains

- There are many potential steps involved when going from "development code" to
  a "production build", for example,
  - Downloading packages, managing dependencies between them
  - Compiling any necessary packages and code
  - Minimizing JavaScript to increase load times
  - Uploading code to server
- Doing all of these steps manually doesn't scale well!
- Not a huge problem with the smaller apps we create in-class
- But with larger apps (100k lines of code, many dependencies), this becomes
  almost impossibly difficult to manage manually
- Most large software projects use toolchains to help perform complex tasks
  related to maintaining, building and deploying applications
- Famous example is [GNU Toolchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_toolchain)
  includes tools such as:
  - GNU make, automation tool for compilation/building
  - GCC, GNU Compiler Collection, a suite of compilers
  - GNU Debugger, a code debugging tool

## React Toolchains

- There are many toolchains for React, the one we will use is a relatively
  simple one called
  [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app)
- Relatively simple because toolchains can get very complex, entire jobs revolve
  around using them
- [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) is an entire industry sub
  discipline focused on building and deploying apps

## npm

- npm is a package manager for JavaScript
- It is the default package manager for NodeJS, and it comes with NodeJS
- NodeJS is a backend JavaScript runtime environment
- npm must stand for node package manager right?
- Actually No!
  `they chose npm because it is easily typed by a right-handed programmer using a US QWERTY keyboard layout, ending with the right-ring-finger in a position to type the key for flags and other command-line arguments`
- You can [download](https://nodejs.org/en) and install the recommended version
  of NodeJS, it will include npm
- npm gives developers access to a huge repository of packages (JS libraries
  like React)
- Some packages are free/public, others paid/private
- Packages are not vetted on submission, can be insecure or even malicious
- npm depends on users to vet packages, can be taken down after submission if
  found to violate policies
- npm uses a file called `package.json` contained in the root directory of an
  app to manage package versions, dependencies, etc
- When packages are installed, they are generally placed in a folder called
  `node_modules`
- Packages can be globally installed too
- npm comes with npx, a package runner that simplifies the execution of packages
- npm is a tool we can use to install packages like React, jQuery, React Router,
  create-react-app, etc

## Using npm, create-react-app

- Open a command prompt (windows) or terminal (Mac) and enter:
- `npx create-react-app my-app`
- This command will create a folder `my-app`, containing everything you need to
  create a React app, and an initial template application
- `my-app` can be whatever name you want
- The folder will contain:
  - `package.json` – primary responsibility is managing dependencies, but other
    app data too (e.g. author)
  - `/public` - contains the page template `index.html`
  - `/src` – contains initial template React app
  - `/build` – contains the build of our application that is suitable for
    hosting
  - `/node_modules` – contains the React modules and many others that
    `create-react-app` adds in as well

## npm start

- To run the application for testing purposes, type the following commands from
  the command line
  - `cd my-app`
  - `npm start`
- This will launch the default web browser, with your web app loaded in from
  http://localhost:3000
- This is a similar idea to using WampServer or XAMPP

## App template

- Let's take a look at what we get when we use `create-react-app`
- Under `/public` we have `index.html`, this is the actual HTML page that is
  loaded
- There is some meta data related to an icon for app, browsers and mobile
  devices use this data
- There is a `div` with `id` set to `root`, this is where our React app will be
  placed
- Under `/src` we have
  - `App.css` – the css for our app, loaded by `App.js`
  - `App.js` – contains the main App component definition
  - `App.test.js` – tests the app, default is to see if the app can be rendered
    without crashing
  - `index.css` – more css for the app, loaded by `index.js`
  - `index.js` – contains the ReactDOM.render call that renders our app in the
    `index.html` root div
  - `logo.svg` – the logo for the template application
  - `reportWebVitals` - can be used to measure app performance

## App template – app.js

- We could place all of our React code inside `app.js` for very small
  applications
- Or we could define our components inside different JavaScript files
- Using `import` statements to import components and other assets needed
- Using `exports` to make components available to other files that can then
  import these components
- In the case of larger apps, splitting our components across multiple files
  becomes absolutely essential

## Imports and exports

- Can use `import { export1, export2, ... } from "module-name"` to
  [import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import)
- Can use `export default name1` to set the default export, and
  `export { name1, name2, ... }` to create named
  [export](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export)

## Assets: CSS, Image files

- See `App.js` for examples of how to include CSS and image files in our
  applications
- Image `logo.svg` and CSS `app.css` is found in `/src` folder

```js
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

<img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
<h1 className="App-title">Welcome to React</h1>
```
