# Bootstrap

- A front-end web development framework
- Developed at Twitter to encourage consistency across internal tools
- Released in 2011, updated consistently since then
- Second-most starred project on GitHub, very popular with web developers!

## Front-end frameworks

- Provide pre-defined css classes
- Allow us to style web apps in a common way
- Provide predefined components that provide some specific functionality
- Typically a set of CSS classes, maybe supported by JavaScript code, along with
  associated expectations around how they are to be used in HTML tags
- E.g. drop-down lists, navigation bars, pagination
- Extensive example code and tutorials make it easy to integrate into our own
  applications

## Front-end framework advantages

- Development time
  - Not re-inventing the wheel, leveraging existing work
- Reliability
  - An entire community to find and fix bugs
- Cross-compatibility
  - So many browsers (Edge, Chrome, Firefox, etc), devices (laptop, desktop,
    tablet, phone), and screen sizes!
  - How can a small development team possibly test across all these possible
    combinations?
  - Latest version of Bootstrap will ensure cross-compatibility

## User interface design advantages

- Framework is tried and tested by millions and so it is known to be
  well-received, what you make may not be!
- Learnability and ease-of-use
  - Users are familiar with the interface components and style from having
    recognized it before on Twitter and other websites
  - Some argue this is a bad thing for branding purposes, but for the most part
    this isn't true...
  - ...imagine how confusing it would be if every Windows app used completely
    different buttons, menus, and drop-downs?

## Bootstrap

- See [documentation and download](https://getbootstrap.com)
- There's a few ways to obtain it depending on the project type...
- But the easiest way is to just use the
  [starter template](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/#starter-template)

## Bootstrap versions

- Version 5 released in May 2021
- Version 5 notably dropped jQuery dependency
- Versions 3 and 4 are still heavily used in industry and by employers
- Part of an [industry trend](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com) towards dropping
  jQuery dependencies in libraries
- Version honestly doesn't matter, it will change again soon, the idea of using
  pre-defined classes and components in structured ways is what matters!

## Bootstrap - Grid System

- Grid system is the most important part of responsive design with Bootstrap
- Rows made up of up to 12 columns, that can be grouped together to create wider
  columns
- Grid system
  - A responsive grid system that scales up to 12 columns of information to the
    appropriate device size
  - A row is used to define a horizontal group of columns
  - Content is places inside the columns
  - Only columns may be immediate children of rows
  - Pre-defined grid classes like .col-xs-4 let us quickly make grid layouts,
    but we can customize our own
  - The 4 part of the pre-defined class tell us that the column using this class
    will span 4 of the 12 columns
- [See documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/layout/grid)

## Bootstrap - Containers

- Bootstrap contents, including grid systems, require a containing element:

```html
<div class="container"><!-- ... --></div>
```

- Bootstrap containers can be fixed with (as above) or fluid:

```html
<div class="container-fluid"><!-- ... --></div>
```

- Fluid width containers won't necessarily stack, columns will just get smaller
- [All Components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/components)

## Responsive utilities

- Display utility classes can be used to
  [hide and un-hide elements](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/display/#hiding-elements)
  based on the screen size

```css
.d-{breakpoint}-{value}
```

- Breakpoint is sm, md, lg, xl
- Value is none, inline, inline-block, block, etc
- The media queries effect screen widths with the given breakpoint or larger
- Need to combine them to do things like only display elements on certain screen
  sizes

## Responsive ratio

- Class [ratio](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/helpers/ratio) allows for
  embedding content that maintains the ratio across screen sizes
- `ratio-AxB` maintains AxB aspect ratio
